## Writing Guidelines

### Tone

- Professional, fact-based, forensic
- No hype, no buzzwords, no evangelism
- Describe what is observed, not what is believed
- Use "what we observe is..." not "obviously..."

### Language

- Use established terminology from the specification
- Do not introduce synonyms for defined terms
- Error descriptions should be diagnostic, not judgmental

### Structure

- Use Markdown headings consistently
- Tables for structured comparisons
- Code blocks for examples
- Keep sections focused and concise
